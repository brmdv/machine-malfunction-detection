# Detecting malfunctioning machines by their sound with ML

Industrial machines need maintenance from time to time. 
In this project, we invesitgat if machine learning classification techniques can be applied on sound recordings of several machines, to detect malfunctions. 


## About the MIMII dataset 

The [MIMII data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09347) is [available](https://zenodo.org/record/3384388) as twelve large zip files, that each contains a multitude of sound recordings in WAVE format. 
There are 4 machine types (valves, fans, slide rails and pumps), each  with 6 different models. 
For each model there is a set of sounds form normal functioning and abnormal.
